        <p>About us, or actually just me. My name is Jochem Grootherder and I am the creator of this webshop.
            The goal of this webshop was an exciting way for me to learn how to create websites.
            Learning new things is always something that I welcome and I want to learn as much as I can.
            I have an education in Embedded Software Development from the Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen.
            I completed this in June 2022, but I was not completely ready to work in IT. 
            Next to my studies I always wanted to work in a restaurant or caf√©, but due to the corona pandemic I had not been able to do so.
            Thats why I started working as a waiter/bartender in a hotel after my studies. During my time of working in a hotel I learned many things
            about providing a good experience for the guests. I went from being a clumsy guy who would always spill food and drinks,
            to being able to carry 3 plates in one hand or carrying a plate of drinks on one hand. But now I have had my fun there and I
            want to start in IT again, but I felt like maybe embedded software was a bit too complicated and not exactly what I would like to do.
            Providing a good user experience for people is something that I enjoyed while working as a waiter/bartender, maybe I could
            create a good user experience in IT as well by doing something with user interfaces. Or maybe I could help improving things by
            doing data analysis. This is the reason I started at Educom as they can help me find a job that would really suit me and it is why 
            I am excited to be a part of their program.

            I grew up in Brummen, a small village in the province Gelderland. I have lived here till I was 21. But then one day I got
            a call from a friend of mine saying a room became available in their student house in Deventer. I was immediately convinced
            that this would be a great new chapter of my life. I lived here till I moved in together with my Czech girlfriend in a studio
            apartment in the centre of Maastricht.
